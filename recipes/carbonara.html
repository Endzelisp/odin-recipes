    <h2>Genuine Traditional Italian Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
    <p>This Italian pasta dish is made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century. Originally from Rome, The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two. Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini are also used. Normally guanciale or pancetta are used for the meat component, but lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><em>350 g (12 oz)</em> of spaghetti</li>
      <li><em>200 g (7 oz)</em> of guanciale</li>
      <li><em>4</em> whole medium eggs (1 egg each yeld)</li>
      <li><em>100 g (1 cup + 1 tablespoon)</em> of grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
      <li>ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>First, boil the water for the pasta while you prepare the carbonara sauce. Remember: 1 liter (4 cups) of water for every 100 g (3,50 oz) of pasta and 15 g (1 tablespoon) of coarse salt per liter (4 cups) of water.</li>
      <li>Cut the guanciale into small pieces (cubes, slices… as you prefer) then cook in a skillet over medium heat for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir occasionally so that it cooks evenly. The more the guanciale cooks, the more its fat will melt and its meat will become crispy.</li>
      <li>No need for oil: guanciale is already fatty, oily and fabulous on its own. If you want, you can add a tablespoon of cooking water and emulsify.</li>
      <li>When it’s ready, turn off the heat, cover with a lid and set aside.</li>
      <li>Now prepare the pecorino cream. So, in a bowl put the eggs and pecorino Romano cheese. Use the whole egg, not only the egg yolk. Pecorino Romano, the only cheese that is recommended for making carbonara, is a very salty and flavorful Italian cheese so there is no need to add salt.</li>
      <li>Add some freshly ground black pepper. Then, mix quickly with a fork – or a hand whisk – until you have a creamy sauce.</li>
      <li>This egg and pecorino cheese sauce should be quite thick. Set it aside for the moment.</li>
      <li>The water should now be boiling so add the salt and cook the spaghetti. If you chose a fairly large pot, the spaghetti should fit comfortably without breaking them. Whole, unbroken spaghetti is best, so you can more easily roll them around the tines of your fork without the help of a spoon. The best way to cook spaghetti without breaking it’s to hold them in a bunch vertically and dip in the salted water.</li>
      <li>Now let go and they will fall in all directions. As they soften, use a fork to let them sink in, then stir. Cook the spaghetti al dente, following the cooking time found on the pasta package.</li>
      <li>Using a spoon for spaghetti, drain the pasta when ready. Then place them in the skillet, over high heat, to season well with the guanciale. <strong>At this step, we have reached the crucial moment of spaghetti carbonara. Not to put tension on it, but this is the fleeting moment in which you can make an immortal dish or one that will be a real failure. So now you have to be quick, ready and ruthless.</strong></li>
      <li>When the spaghetti and guanciale sizzle in the pan, TURN OFF THE HEAT, otherwise the eggs will overcook and you’ll end up with scrambled eggs and pasta!</li>
      <li>Now quickly add the eggs and pecorino cream to the hot pasta and stir. The pan is not too hot, this way the eggs will cook without lumps. Pay attention to the consistency, which should be creamy, but not runny. If you notice that your carbonara is too runny, add some grated pecorino cheese.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, if you see that it’s too sticky and dense, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of cooking water. If you used a spoon to drain the spaghetti, the reserving pasta water may come in handy in this step.</li>
      <li>Authentic spaghetti carbonara is ready. So, with the help of a ladle and a fork, create a pasta nest and place it on a plate.</li>
      <li>Add the guanciale (what’s left in the pan), freshly ground black pepper and grated pecorino romano to taste. Serve and enjoy!</li>
